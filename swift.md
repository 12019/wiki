This is a brief overview of Swift programming language.

# Basic Type
Use let to make a constant and var to make a variable.
```
var myVariable = 42
myVariable = 50
let myConstant = 42
```
Specify the type by writing it after the variable, separated by a colon.
```
let implicitInteger = 70
let implicitDouble = 70.0
let explicitDouble: Double = 70
```
You convert an Int to a String.
```
let label = "The width is "
let width = 94
let widthLabel = label + String(width)
```
